# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Well... What does it do? 

Tweeter allows the user to browse a dashboard of tweets created by people around the web! Share your own thoughts with the world by posting a tweet of your own. Be amazed by the wonderous hover effects and clickless pretty symbols on the screen - you'll love it!
